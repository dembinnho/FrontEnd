## Quick information
This project is a front application linked to a node/express backend.
It is meant to run on Chrome, however you can launch it on an Android or IOS device (will not run correctly).

I used the MVC pattern, as in flutter everything is a widget and we compose widget with others to build screen.

the Lib directory contains

    --> Models (contains the used models (objects to instanciate) (Location))
    --> Utils (contains the utilitaries (for instance the image handler))
    --> Widgets (contains widgets used heavily in the app)
    --> UI (contains the app pages)
    
We used http protocol to make get and post request
